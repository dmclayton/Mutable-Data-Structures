Data structures are fundamental to essentially all areas of computer science.  
The traditional approach to analyzing the correctness of a data structure 
is to assume that all inputs, and all queries, 
are independent of any internal randomness used to construct it. 
But as highlighted by Naor and
Yogev~\cite{naor2015bloom}, there are important use-cases in which the inputs and queries
may be chosen \emph{adversarially} and \emph{adaptively}, based on partial
information and prior observations about the data structure. Attacks of this
sort can be used to dramatically degrade the performance of real systems
\cite{crosby2003denial,gerbet2015power,lipton1993clocked}.

Naor and Yogev (NY) formalized a notion of adversarial correctness for
Bloom-filter-like structures. (Recall that
a Bloom filter provides a compact representation of a set~$\col$, and supports
set-membership queries.)
%Bloom filters are
%ubiquitous in distributed computing, including web caches (e.g., Squid) and hash
%tables (e.g., BigTable and Hadoop), resource and packet routing, and network
%measurement. (We refer the reader to the
%surveys~\cite{broder2004network,tarkoma2012theory} for a comprehensive list of
%applications.) 
In the NY notion, the adversary must choose~$\col$ all at once,
and then adaptively queries the data structure in order to induce
erroneous responses.  In the case of Bloom filters, the only possible
type of error is a false-positive.
%
But many modern applications require data structures to (compactly) represent \emph{streams} of
data, not static collections (typicallly, sets) whose size is bounded by some number that is
fixed \emph{a priori}.  

For example, the count-min
sketch structure~\cite{xxx} is used to compactly represent the number
of times a particular datum has appeared, so far, in the input
stream.  Additionally, some applications require the ability to
add\emph{and remove} elements from effective~$\col$ that is
represented.  The count-min sketch, and a variety of other
space-efficient structures, support this.

As such, we significantly expand upon NY to consider data structure
correctness in the presense of adversaries that adaptively create and
mutate~$\col$, in an effort to induce query-response errors.  We
define a syntax for mutable data structures, formalize two notions of
correctness (capturing settings in which representations
are public/private, respectively), and exercise these by
considering a collection of real-world data structures: Bloom
filters~\cite{xxx}, counting filters~\cite{xxx}, cuckoo
filters~\cite{xxx}, and count-min sketches~\cite{xxx}. \tsnote{Update
  if we add more.}  In addition to the basic version of these, we
explore variations that allow for ``salted'' representations (i.e.,
per-representation randomness), secret keys (so that the mapping
from~$\col$ to representation is unpredictable, even if the
representation of one or more closely related~$\col'$ are known), or both.

Note that the notion of query-response error becomes considerably more
general in our setting.   Counting filters ---~loosely, Bloom filters
with an array of counters rather than single bits~--- support updates
of the form \emph{remove~$x$ from the representation of~$\col$}.  If
$x \in \col$ when this update is processed, then the appropriate
counters are decremented.  If $x \not\in \col$, however, counters will
be erroneously decremented, leading to the possibility of
false-negative errors when set-membership queries are made for some $y
\in \col$.
%
More generally, the count-min sketch supports queries of the
form \emph{how many times has~$x$ appeared, so far?}  One could define
error in an absolute sense, i.e., the data structure errs if its
response is not exactly correct.  But even in the non-adaptive
setting, traditional analyses guarantee only that the response will be
\emph{close} to the exact number, with some probability that is close
to one.  

\tsnote{OLD INTRO follows}
In support of this, we give a precise syntax for data structures as an abstract
primitive.  Our syntax captures a wide variety of structures used in practice;
%
to focus the exposition, we will mostly concentrate on the heavily
used Bloom filter~\cite{bloom1970space} and some important variants. 

%
Bloom filters have also been modified and co-opted for security-critical
applications; perhaps unsurprisingly, things go wrong. Schnell
\etal~\cite{schnell2011novel} proposed using secretly-keyed Bloom filters in
order to enable privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) across data sets.  This
was deployed in medical-data applications in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and
Switzerland~\cite{niedermeyer2014cryptanalysis}. As one exercise of our
notions, we study their proposal in detail. % in Section~\ref{sec:bf-bigram}.
%

We do not focus exclusively on Bloom filters, nor on data structures
that support only set-membership queries.  To hint at the broader scope of our formalisms, we analyze the
so-called ``Bloomier filter''~\cite{chazelle2004bloomier}, which provides a
compact representation of a \emph{dictionary} data structure.\footnote{Despite the
name, the Bloom filter data structure and the Bloomier filter data structure are
\emph{very} different primitives.}

\heading{Data structures and their correctness.}
%
We formalize a data structure as a triple of algorithms $(\Rep, \Qry, \Up)$ denoting
the \emph{representation}, \emph{query-evaluation}, and \emph{Update} algorithms, respectively.
Associated to the data structure is a set of supported queries~$\mathcal{Q}$.
The representation algorithm is randomized, taking as input a
key~$\ky$ and a collection of data~$\col$, and returning a
representation~$\pub$ of~$\col$.  (To capture unkeyed data structures,
one sets $\ky=\varepsilon$.)
%
The deterministic query-evaluation algorithm~$\Qry$ uses~$\ky$ and $\pub$ in
order to respond to a requested query~$\qry \in \queries$ on~$\col$.
\textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

For better efficiency, many data structures only approximately
represent the collection~$\col$. In this case, the query-evaluation
algorithm~$\Qry$ may err in its response to queries.  \oldstuff{Roughly
speaking,  our notion of adversarial correctness (\errep) captures how
difficult it is for an attacker (given $\pub$) to find~$r>0$ distinct queries on
which $\Qry$ returns an incorrect answer.}

For Bloom filters, the representation~$\pub$ includes a bit array~$M$ that
represents a set~$\col \subseteq \elts$ using hash functions
$h_1,\ldots,h_k$. The supported queries are the predicates
$\{\qry_x\}_{x\in\elts}$, where $\qry_x(\col)=1$ iff $x \in \col$. It is well
known that Bloom filters may have false positives, and their false-positive rate
for \emph{independently chosen} inputs and queries is well understood. (See
Appendix~\ref{sec:mitz}.) Our correctness notion quantitatively captures the
error rate even in the presence of an attacker that adaptively attempts to
induce errors. \textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

We note that Naor and Yogev~\cite{naor2015bloom} were the first to formalize
adversarial correctness of Bloom filters and, indeed, their work
provided inspiration for this paper.  Our work significantly extends
theirs in several ways, as we will detail, shortly.  \textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

  \anytodo{Several reviewers have made the same complaint : why these notions?
  In particular, are they interesting beyond an academic exercise?  We need to
  address this head-on.  One idea is to try to build something on top of these
  notions, but I really see that as a separate paper.  Unless we can build some
  \emph{well known} primitive... but I'm not sure what it would be, or how
  interesting.}

  \cpnote{Alex Davidson's paper (ia.cr/2017/448) suggests that garbled Bloom
  filters (or some variation of them) can be used for private-set intersection. We
  could ask if privacy in our sense suffices for this application.
  But \ssrep is not the right notion since it requires a key, and \owrep is
  probably too weak. Davidson views GBFs as distributional virtual black-box
  obfuscators, which are stronger than \owrep-secure structures.}
  %
  \cpnote{To my thinking, these notions were originally devised from the
  perspective of what security properties do existing data structures admit. If
  our intention is to use these properties in order to achieve some higher-level
  goal, I don't think we have the right ones. Short of strengthening them, I think
  our best bet  is to \emph{own} our original perspective. To that end, the place
  we need the most motivation is \ssrep privacy of $\SKBF$, the PRF-based BF. See
  my comments in Section~\ref{sec:bf-prf} for two ways we've already thought of.}

\heading{Constructions we analyze.}
%
We put our syntax and security notions to work in several case studies.
%
The brief description of Bloom filters given above was silent as to how the hash
functions $h_1, \ldots, h_k$ are chosen, and whether or not they are
public. In fact, these details have a significant effect on what notions of
security the resulting structure satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    (Section~\ref{sec:bf}) If the hash functions are fixed and known to the
    attacker prior to the filter being constructed, the data structure offers
    neither correctness nor privacy for any practically interesting parameters.
    We show this by exhibiting explicit attacks and analyzing their performance.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-salt}) If \emph{salted} hash functions are used,
    and the adversary is given the salt only after the collection $\col$ is
    chosen, then %with modest changes to the parameters (i.e., the filter length and number of hashes), 
    the structure can achieve the same correctness guarantees in the adversarial setting as do Bloom filters in the traditional
    non-adversarial setting. 
    %(Our analysis here treats the hash functions as random oracles; the usual analysis treats them as ideal random functions.)
    We also show that this structure achieves our privacy notion of one-wayness.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-prf}) We explore a natural, keyed variant of a
    Bloom filter in which the hash functions are derived from a secretly keyed
    pseudorandom function. (This is similar to a construction proposed by Naor
    and Yogev~\cite{naor2015bloom}.) We show that this variant enjoys
    simulation-based privacy, as well as a tighter security bound for
    correctness than the salted Bloom filter.
\end{itemize}
%
\noindent
Our particular realization of the salted and secretly keyed Bloom filters
leverages results from Kirsch and Mitzenmacher~\cite{kirsch2006less} that allow
one to effectively implement $h_1,\ldots, h_k$ by making only two \emph{actual}
evaluations of an underlying hash function or PRF, respectively.
%
In addition to the comprehensive analysis of Bloom filters described above, we
also apply our definitions to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-bigram}) A keyed structure for privacy-preserving
    record linkage introduced by Schnell \etal~\cite{schnell2011novel}, and
    subsequently attacked by Niedermeyer
    \etal~\cite{niedermeyer2014cryptanalysis}. In our framework we are able to
    show precisely how their scheme breaks down.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:dict}) A dictionary proposed by Charles
    and Chellapilla~\cite{charles2008bloomier2} that stores a set of~$n$
    key/value pairs, where the keys are arbitrary bitstrings and the values are
    of length at most~$m$, using just $O(mn)$ bits.
\end{itemize}

\heading{Future research directions.}
%
\ignore{
It would be interesting to extend our work to the case of \emph{mutable} data
structures. Specific examples to consider here are counting Bloom
filters~\cite{fan2000summary}, scalable Bloom
filters~\cite{almeida2007scalable}, count-min
sketches~\cite{cormode2005improved}, and hierarchical Bloom
filters~\cite{zhu2004hierarchical}, to name just a few in the extended Bloom
filter family.

% NOTE(all) Removed these citations: \cite{broder2004network,nojima2009cryptographically}
Our goal is to establish foundations for the security of  data
structures. But it would certainly be interesting to analyze high-level
protocols that use these data structures, e.g.
content-distribution networks~\cite{byers2002informed}, where many servers
propagate representations of their local cache to their neighbors. The Bloom
filter family alone has a wide range of practical applications, for example in
large database query processing~\cite{broder2004network}, routing algorithms for
peer-to-peer networks~\cite{reynolds2003efficient}, protocols for establishing
linkages between medical-record databases~\cite{schnell2011novel}, fair routing
of TCP packets~\cite{feng2001stochastic}, and Bitcoin wallet
synchronization~\cite{gervais2014privacy}.
%
Analyzing higher-level primitives or protocols will require establishing
appropriate syntax and security notions for those, too; hence we leave this for
future work.
