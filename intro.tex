Data structures are fundamental to essentially all areas of computer science.
The traditional approach to analyzing the correctness of a data structure is to
assume that all inputs, and all queries, are independent of any internal
randomness used to construct it.  But as highlighted by Naor and
Yogev (CRYPTO '15~\cite{naor2015bloom}), there are important use-cases in which the inputs
and queries may be chosen \emph{adversarially} and \emph{adaptively}, based on
partial information and prior observations about the data structure. Attacks of
this sort can be used to disrupt or reduce the availability of real systems
\cite{crosby2003denial,gerbet2015power,lipton1993clocked}.

Naor and Yogev (NY) formalized a notion of adversarial correctness for
Bloom-filter-like structures. A Bloom filter provides a compact representation,
which we denote by $\pub$, of a set~$\col$. The representation is a length-$m$
bit-array (initally all zeros), and elements $x \in \col$ are added to it by
computing hash values $h_1(x),h_2(x),\ldots,h_k(x)\in [m]$, then setting the
indicated array positions to~$1$.  A Bloom filter supports set membership
queries, i.e., ``is $x\in\col$?'', by hashing~$x$ and responding positively iff
all of the indicated positions hold a 1-bit.  When $h_1,\ldots,h_k$ are modeled
as random functions, and~$\col$ is independent of these, classical results
relate $|\col|,m,k$ to the probability of false-positive query
responses~\cite{broder2004network,kirsch2006less}.
%
NY revisited these results from a security perspective, by
formalizing an attack model in which the adversary specifies a
(fixed) set~$\col$ that may
depend on the hash functions, and is then allowed to adaptively query the
(immutable) representation~$\pub$ in an effort to induce errors.

This work expands upon NY in several, practically relevant ways.  To begin, our
attack model allows the adversary to adaptively \emph{update} the
collection~$\col$, thereby capturing settings in which the target data may
change over time, e.g., streaming data applications.
%
\todo{DC}{Is there a suitable reference for this? If so, then add it here. If
it's not already in related work, then add it.}
%
Correspondingly, we consider data structures that natively support
\emph{mutable} representations. Concrete examples of these include the counting
filter~\cite{fan2000summary}, count-min sketch~\cite{cormode2005improved},
cuckoo filter~\cite{fan2014cuckoo}, and stable Bloom
filter~\cite{deng2006approximately}.

What all of these have in common is that they are designed to \emph{compactly}
represent the data so that certain types of mutations and queries are supported,
but a small amount of error is permitted.
%
While the Bloom filter was designed to represent data collections~$\col$
that are sets, streaming data is better modeled as a multiset.  Natural
questions about multisets extend beyond set-membership; for example, an
important question in practice is \emph{how many times does~$x$ appear
in~$\col$?} As with Bloom filters, the challenge is to answer this question with
as little space consumption as possible, at the cost of admitting a reaosonable
amount of error.

Thus, our syntatic definition of data structures admits both mutability and rich
query spaces.  Formally, a data structure is a triple of algorithms $(\Rep,
\Qry, \Up)$ denoting the \emph{representation}, \emph{query-evaluation}, and
\emph{Update} algorithms, respectively. Associated to the data structure is a
set of supported query \emph{functions}~$\mathcal{Q}$, and a set~$\mathcal{U}$
of allowed update functions.  For reasons we will elucidate in a moment, all
three algorithms take a key~$\ky$ as input, and both~$\Rep$ and~$\Up$ may be
randomized.


The combination of mutability and rich query spaces has significant
implications for security. Consider the counting filter
structure~\cite{fan2000summary}, which compactly (and approximately) represents
an updatable multiset~$\col$. Loosely, the representation of~$\col$ is an array
of counters. To add an instance of~$x$, the representation is
updated by hashing~$x$ to identify particular counters, and then
incrementing these.  An instance of~$x$ is removed
by hashing and decrementing the counters. Whether~$x$ is a member of the
multiset is determined by checking whether all of the counters associated with
it are nonzero. (Counters are
typically floored at 0.) In this setting, with a single type of query ---~is $v>0$?~--
there is the potential for both false-positive \emph{and} false-negative
responses.  In particular, if the representation is updated by
``removing'' an element~$y$ that does not appear in the
underlying~$\col$, one or more of the counters associated to~$x$ may
be decremented, potentially causing~$x$ to become a false negative.

Although the structures we consider here only have one or two possible types of
error, we want to capture the idea that in general some types of error may be
worse than others. Rather than making a simple count of the errors the adversary
accumulates, then, we use an error-cost function~$\delta$: if the correct
response to a query is~$a$ and the data structure responds with~$a'$, the cost
of the error is $\delta(a,a') \geq 0$.

Security games are additionally parameterized by an total-cost threshold, and
the adversary is considered to ``win'' if the total cost of the errors it induces
is greater than this value.  As we will see, even calculating the
total cost is not straightforward.  In particular, we must determine whether
or not the cost of a given error should be carried across (adaptive,
adversarial) updates to~$\col$ and its representation.

\todo{TS}{Name and summarize the security notions.}

To summarize, our high-level contributions are: formal syntax for
mutable data structures, and two notions of adversarial
correctness for these.  Our notions capture settings in which representations
are made public, or kept private, respectively.

We exercise our syntax and notions by analyzing three important, real-world data
structures: Bloom filters~\cite{bloom1970space} (Section~\ref{sec:bloom}), count
min-sketches~\cite{cormode2005improved} (Section~\ref{sec:sketch}), and counting
filters~\cite{fan2000summary} (Section~\ref{sec:count}), summarized in
Figure~\ref{fig:tab-structures}. Each of these supports different queries and
update operations, and taken together, these structures exhibit the full range
adversarial settings our notions encounter. It may initially come as a surprise
that \emph{none of these structures meets security in our setting}, at least as
they are usually deployed. In particular, if the data being represented,
updates, and queris all may depend on the choice of hash function, then each of
these structures is susceptible to a class of attacks we call \emph{target-set
coverage attacks}, which we describe in Section~\ref{sec:bad-bfs}. However,
these structures can be refined in simple, intuitive ways that allow us to prove
upper bounds.

\heading{Bloom filters}
We show an efficient attack against the standard Bloom filter construction,
where the adversary is able to cause target elements to become false positives
for the filter. We show that, if the filter is immutable but publicly available
after construction, using a per-representation randomly-generated salt provides
a security bound, though to achieve small error rates it may also be necessary
to increase the size of the filter. In settings where the filter may be updated
after its original construction, we show that it is necessary to either use a
secret key or to keep the filter itself private in addition to using salts.
Finally, we show how thresholding the number of 1s in the filter is an
alternative to capping the number of elements in the underlying set, and
establish better error bounds for the private salted filter when thresholding is
used.

\heading{Count min-sketches}
Count min-sketches use a two-dimensional array of counters to support
representations of data streams along with more complex queries than Bloom
filters allow, such as frequency queries. Inserting an element into the sketch
increments a single counter in each row of the array, determined using a hash
function. Unlike with Bloom filters, elements can also be deleted from the
sketch by decrementing the relevant counters. First, we show that public
sketches are intrinsically insecure, since the more flexible queries and updates
provide potential adversaries with attacks that are impossible in the case of
ordinary Bloom filters. We then establish an error bound for the
private-representation setting, using the modifications of a per-representation
random salt and a thresholding technique similar to that used for Bloom filters.

\heading{Counting filters}
Counting filters are a simple modification of Bloom filters which allow for
deletion, given by replacing each bit in the filter with a counter. Each
insertion increments the counters indicated by the hash functions, while
deletion decrements the same counters. We find that counting filters are
insecure if they are visible to the adversary, and in fact they are vulnerable
to the same attack we describe for the count min-sketch. We then once more apply
the modifications of using a per-representation random salt and a thresholding
assumption to prevent the filter from becoming too full, and demonstrate an
error bound comparable to the count min-sketch bound.

It would be interesting to extend our work to the case of \emph{mutable} data
structures. Specific examples to consider here are counting Bloom
filters~\cite{fan2000summary}, scalable Bloom

Our goal is to establish foundations for the security of  data
structures. But it would certainly be interesting to analyze high-level
protocols that use these data structures, e.g.
content-distribution networks~\cite{byers2002informed}, where many servers
propagate representations of their local cache to their neighbors. The Bloom
filter family alone has a wide range of practical applications, for example in
large database query processing~\cite{broder2004network}, routing algorithms for
peer-to-peer networks~\cite{reynolds2003efficient}, protocols for establishing
linkages between medical-record databases~\cite{schnell2011novel}, fair routing
of TCP packets~\cite{feng2001stochastic}, and Bitcoin wallet
synchronization~\cite{gervais2014privacy}.
%
Analyzing higher-level primitives or protocols will require establishing
appropriate syntax and security notions for those, too; hence we leave this for
future work.

To our knowledge, ours is the first work to propose general
notions of \emph{privacy} for abstract data structures.  However, a variety of
data structures with interesting privacy properties have been proposed.  For
example, variants of Bloom filters that ensure privacy of the \emph{query} have
been studied~\cite{bellovin2004privacy,nojima2009cryptographically}.

Bloom filters are
ubiquitous in distributed computing, including web caches (e.g., Squid) and hash
tables (e.g., BigTable and Hadoop), resource and packet routing, and network
measurement. (We refer the reader to the
surveys~\cite{broder2004network,tarkoma2012theory} for a comprehensive list of
applications.) 
Bloom filters have also been modified and co-opted for security-critical
applications; perhaps unsurprisingly, things go wrong. Schnell
\etal~\cite{schnell2011novel} proposed using secretly-keyed Bloom filters in
order to enable privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) across data sets.  This
was deployed in medical-data applications in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and
Switzerland~\cite{niedermeyer2014cryptanalysis}.

\heading{Data structures and their correctness.}
%
We formalize a data structure as a triple of algorithms $(\Rep, \Qry, \Up)$ denoting
the \emph{representation}, \emph{query-evaluation}, and \emph{Update} algorithms, respectively.
Associated to the data structure is a set of supported queries~$\mathcal{Q}$.
The representation algorithm is randomized, taking as input a
key~$\ky$ and a collection of data~$\col$, and returning a
representation~$\pub$ of~$\col$.  (To capture unkeyed data structures,
one sets $\ky=\varepsilon$.)
%
The deterministic query-evaluation algorithm~$\Qry$ uses~$\ky$ and $\pub$ in
order to respond to a requested query~$\qry \in \queries$ on~$\col$.
\textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

For better efficiency, many data structures only approximately
represent the collection~$\col$. In this case, the query-evaluation
algorithm~$\Qry$ may err in its response to queries.  \oldstuff{Roughly
speaking,  our notion of adversarial correctness (\errep) captures how
difficult it is for an attacker (given $\pub$) to find~$r>0$ distinct queries on
which $\Qry$ returns an incorrect answer.}

For Bloom filters, the representation~$\pub$ includes a bit array~$M$ that
represents a set~$\col \subseteq \elts$ using hash functions
$h_1,\ldots,h_k$. The supported queries are the predicates
$\{\qry_x\}_{x\in\elts}$, where $\qry_x(\col)=1$ iff $x \in \col$. It is well
known that Bloom filters may have false positives, and their false-positive rate
for \emph{independently chosen} inputs and queries is well understood. (See
Appendix~\ref{sec:mitz}.) Our correctness notion quantitatively captures the
error rate even in the presence of an attacker that adaptively attempts to
induce errors. \textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

We note that Naor and Yogev~\cite{naor2015bloom} were the first to formalize
adversarial correctness of Bloom filters and, indeed, their work
provided inspiration for this paper.  Our work significantly extends
theirs in several ways, as we will detail, shortly.  \textcolor{blue}{[[...]]}

\heading{Constructions we analyze.}
%
We put our syntax and security notions to work in several case studies.
%
The brief description of Bloom filters given above was silent as to how the hash
functions $h_1, \ldots, h_k$ are chosen, and whether or not they are
public. In fact, these details have a significant effect on what notions of
security the resulting structure satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    (Section~\ref{sec:bf}) If the hash functions are fixed and known to the
    attacker prior to the filter being constructed, the data structure offers
    neither correctness nor privacy for any practically interesting parameters.
    We show this by exhibiting explicit attacks and analyzing their performance.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-salt}) If \emph{salted} hash functions are used,
    and the adversary is given the salt only after the collection $\col$ is
    chosen, then %with modest changes to the parameters (i.e., the filter length and number of hashes), 
    the structure can achieve the same correctness guarantees in the adversarial setting as do Bloom filters in the traditional
    non-adversarial setting. 
    %(Our analysis here treats the hash functions as random oracles; the usual analysis treats them as ideal random functions.)
    We also show that this structure achieves our privacy notion of one-wayness.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-prf}) We explore a natural, keyed variant of a
    Bloom filter in which the hash functions are derived from a secretly keyed
    pseudorandom function. (This is similar to a construction proposed by Naor
    and Yogev~\cite{naor2015bloom}.) We show that this variant enjoys
    simulation-based privacy, as well as a tighter security bound for
    correctness than the salted Bloom filter.
\end{itemize}
%
\noindent
Our particular realization of the salted and secretly keyed Bloom filters
leverages results from Kirsch and Mitzenmacher~\cite{kirsch2006less} that allow
one to effectively implement $h_1,\ldots, h_k$ by making only two \emph{actual}
evaluations of an underlying hash function or PRF, respectively.
%
In addition to the comprehensive analysis of Bloom filters described above, we
also apply our definitions to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item (Section~\ref{sec:bf-bigram}) A keyed structure for privacy-preserving
    record linkage introduced by Schnell \etal~\cite{schnell2011novel}, and
    subsequently attacked by Niedermeyer
    \etal~\cite{niedermeyer2014cryptanalysis}. In our framework we are able to
    show precisely how their scheme breaks down.

  \item (Section~\ref{sec:dict}) A dictionary proposed by Charles
    and Chellapilla~\cite{charles2008bloomier2} that stores a set of~$n$
    key/value pairs, where the keys are arbitrary bitstrings and the values are
    of length at most~$m$, using just $O(mn)$ bits.
\end{itemize}
}
