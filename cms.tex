The count min-sketch (CMS) data structure is designed to concisely estimate the
number of times a datum has occurred in a data stream. In other words, it is
designed to estimate the frequency of each element of a multiset.  The data
structure is similar to a Bloom filter, but instead of a length-$m$ array of
bits it uses a $k$-by-$m$ array of counters. It is designed to deal with streams
of data in the non-negative turnstile model~\cite{cormode2005improved}, which
means the sketch accomodates both insertions and deletions but does not allow
any entries to have a negative frequency. Our construction
$\sketch[R,\ell,\lambda]$ defined in Figure~\ref{fig:bf-def} involves an
$\ell$-thresholded variation of this structure. As in the case of Bloom filters,
this does not significantly change the operation of the sketch in a
non-adversarial setting, since in general~$\ell$ can be closely approximated
given knowledge of~$n$.
%
\cpnote{This isn't clear. What's~$n$? How do I approximate~$\ell$ given ``knowledge'' of~$n$?}
%
In the presence of an adversary, however, we expect this variation to provide
better security bounds.
%
\cpnote{Better than what? If you had capped instead of thresholded? This section
and the previous one should be readable on their own. If you want to bring up
points you made in the last section, that's totally fine, but you need to point
the reader to where they can read more.}

We will show that, in the \errep\ setting, the count min-sketch structure is
insecure regardless of whether $\ell$-thresholding is used or not, and
regardless of the details of the behavior of the function $R$. On the other
hand, we show that \erreps\ security is achievable even under the assumption
that a salted but unkeyed hash function is used, i.e. $\lambda > 0$ but $\keys =
\{\emptyset\}$.

\heading{Non-adaptive error bound}
%
The CMS is designed to minimize the number of elements whose
frequencies are overestimated, while still allowing for reasonably low memory
usage. For a function $\rho$ and integer $\lambda\ge0$, let
$\sketch[\id^\rho,n,\lambda] = (\Rep^\rho,\Qry^\rho,\Up^\rho)$ as defined
previously. If $\col$ is a multiset containing a total of $n$ elements
(counting duplicates as separate elements), i.e. $\col \in \Func(\bits^*,\N)$ in
our syntax, and $x \in \bits^*$ is any string, possibly but not necessarily a
member of $\col$, we define the error probability as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bf-fp}
  \begin{aligned}
    P_{k,m}(n) =
      \Pr\big[&\rho \getsr \Func(\bits^*,[m]^k);
              \pub \getsr \Rep^\rho(\setS): \\
              &\Qry^\rho(\pub, \qry_x) > \qry_x(\setS)+\frac{en}{m} \given \pub \ne \bot
      \big] \,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
(Here as above, $e$ denotes the base of the natural logarithm.)
%
Informally, $P_{k,m}(n)$ is the probability that some~$x$ is overestimated by a
non-negligible amount in the representation of some $\setS$ containing a total
of $n$ elements, when a random function is used for hashing. Cormode and
Muthukrishnan~\cite{cormode2005improved} show that this probability is bounded
above by $e^{-k}$. This structure does not provide a bound for underestimation
of frequencies, since it is designed for use cases where overestimates are
considered harmful but underestimates are not.

\heading{Error function for frequency queries}
%
The count min-sketch is designed for settings where overestimation in particular
is undesirable, and so we aim to provide tight bounds on the size of
overestimates but makes no guarantees about underestimates. To make the bounds
simpler while staying conservative in our assumptions, we will use an error
function that counts \emph{any} overestimate as an error, not just overestimates
larger than some lower bound of significance. In particular, we define~$\delta$
as
%
\begin{equation}
  \delta(x, y) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if}\ x > y \\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Insecurity of public sketches}\label{sec:pub-sketch-bad}

Unlike in the Bloom filter case, good security bounds cannot be achieved for a
count-min sketch in the \errep\ setting even if salts and/or private keys are
used. The insecurity is due to the relative power of the $\UPO$ oracle compared
to the Bloom filter. Not only does it allow for deletion as well as
insertion, but since updates are \emph{added} to the representation rather than
being combined with bitwise-OR, the adversary gains more information from
seeing updates occur. Because of these differences, the adversary can mount
an attack similar to the target-set coverage attack for a Bloom filter even if a
PRF is used for
hashing. First, the adversary calls $\REPO(\emptyset)$ to get an empty
representation. The adversary can then call $\UPO$ to insert an element into the
set, see exactly what the outputs of each of the hash functions are, and then
call $\UPO$ again to delete the element. By doing this repeatedly, an adversary
can determine the outputs of the PRF for $u$ different inputs using $2u$ calls
to $\UPO$. Once a sufficiently large number of PRF outputs has been determined,
the adversary can construct the test and target set used for the target-set
coverage attack (Section~\ref{sec:bad-bfs}). The adversary then calls $\UPO$ several more times to insert
each element of the test set into the sketch, and then
each element of the target set will be overestimated.

In actual use, this specific attack may not be feasible for the adversary.
However, as long as the sketch is public, the adversary can easily determine the
exact results of inserting or deleting any element just by seeing which counters
are incremented or decremented. For this reason it is not enough that the
function used to perform queries and updates is impossible for the adversary to
simulate, since the adversary can build a lookup table just by watching the
sketch as it is updated. Instead, we must require that the sketch itself be kept
secret from the adversary.

\subsection{Private, $\ell$-thresholded sketches}

Given the success of $\ell$-thresholding in the case of Bloom filters, we
continue using this tweak in the case of count min-sketches. Between
thresholding and the use of a per-representation random salt, we are able to
establish an upper bound on the number of overestimates in a count min-sketch.
However, the bound is not quite as good as in the case of a salted and
thresholded Bloom filter, which is unsurprising given the increased flexibility
provided by the update algorithm coupled with the additional
information returned by the query evaluation algorithm.
%
Formally, we consider the structure given by $\Pi = \sketch[H,\ell,\lambda]$ for
a hash function $H: \bits^* \to [m]^k$, which we will model as a random oracle.

\begin{theorem}[\erreps\ security of thresholded CMS]\label{thm:scms-erreps-th}
Let $p_\ell = ((\ell+1)/m)^k$. For all $q_R, q_T, q_H, r, t \geq 0$
it holds that
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Adv{\erreps}_{\Pi,\delta,r}(O(t),\,&q_R,q_T,q_U,q_H,q_V) \leq \\
     & q_R \cdot \left[\frac{q_H}{2^\lambda} + e^{r'-p_\ell q_T}\left(\frac{p_\ell q_T}{r'}\right)^r\right],
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $H$ is modeled as a random oracle, $r' = \lfloor r/(k+1) \rfloor$, and $r'
> p_\ell q_T$.
\end{theorem}

The theorem uses several reductions to gradually whittle away at the flexibility
the adversary has in performing repeated insertions, deletions, and queries to
the same elements. The $r'$ in place of $r$ in the bound comes from the fact
that, if the adversary finds that some $x$ is overestimated, it may be able to
produce as many as $k$ additional overestimates by inserting $x$. We take this
into account by automatically giving the adversary credit for all $k$ additional
overestimates as soon as it discovers the false positive. After taking this into
account, we can reduce to the standard binomial argument in which the adversary
seeks to find $r'$ overestimates by making arbitrary queries.
%
We defer the proof to Appendix~\ref{sec:proof/scms-erreps-th}.

\subsection{Discussion}

Unlike Bloom filters, there is no simple tweak that can be performed
to a count min-sketch to provide good \errep\ security bounds. In particular, it
does not achieve security even in the immutable setting, and adding a secret key
does not help.
%
However, the bound above shows that in settings where sketches can be assumed
secret it is possible to prove an upper bound on the number of overestimates an
adversary can cause. In particular, we recommend the combination of random
per-representation salts and $\ell$-thresholding in order to mitigate possible
attacks in the \erreps\ setting.

The bound we achieve is based on the same binomial bound as in the case of Bloom
filters, but has a notable difference in the form of $r'$ replacing $r$. This
negatively impacts the amount of space the filter must take up in order to
provide low error bounds, but because the scaling factor between $r$ and $r'$ is
only $k+1$, the difference should not be unacceptably extreme given reasonable
parameter choices. We also note that it is possible this bound can be improved
to reduce the impact on sketch size, since the initial factor of $q_R$ does not
have an obvious attack associated with it which would make this bound tight.

(The same is true, of course, of Bloom filters.)
