Counting filters are a modified version of Bloom filters which are designed to,
like a count min-sketch, allow for deletion as well as insertion. Unlike CMSs,
however, counting filters are designed to handle set membership queries rather
than frequency queries. Despite this, the two structures are closely related in
terms of security properties. We show that \errep\ security is similarly
impossible, but employing $\ell$-thresholding allows for \erreps\ security witha
bound that is close to count min-sketch.

\heading{Error function for frequency queries}
%
Unlike with a Bloom filter or count min-sketch, counting filters must account
for two different types of errors: false positives and false negatives. To be as
general as possible, we define a parametrized error function~$\delta$ for
positive $\delta^+, \delta^- \in \R$ as
\begin{equation}
  \delta(x, y) =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if}\ x = y \\
    \delta^+ & \text{if}\ x = 1, y = 0 \\
    \delta^- & \text{if}\ x = 0, y = 1
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This means that false positives are given a weight of $\delta^+$ while false
negatives are given a weight of $\delta^-$, and correct responses are given a
weight of 0.

\subsection{Insecurity of public counting filters}
Any counting filter construction necessarily fails to satisfy \errep\
correctness for the same reasons as in the case of count min-sketch. In
particular, the adversary can call $\REPO(\emptyset)$ to receive an empty
representation, insert an element $x$, observe which counters are incremented by
this insertion, and then delete $x$. By doing this repeatedly, the adversary can
gain information about which elements overlap with which combinations of other
elements, and can therefore mount the same attack described in
Section~\ref{sec:pub-sketch-bad}.

\subsection{Private Thresholded Counting Filters}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:counting-erreps}
Fix integers $q_R,q_T,q_U,q_H,q_V, r, t \geq 0$, let $p_\ell = ((\ell+1)/m)^k$,
and let
$r' = \lfloor r/\max(\delta^+,k\delta^-) \rfloor$. For all such
$q_R,q_T,$ $q_U,q_H,q_V,r$, and~$t$, if $r' > p_\ell q_T$ then
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
   \Adv{\erreps}_{\Pi,\delta,r}(O(t),\,&q_R,q_T,q_U,q_H,q_V) \leq\\
     & q_R \cdot \left[\frac{q_H}{2^\lambda} + e^{r'-p_\ell q_T}\left(\frac{p_\ell q_T}{r'}\right)^{r'}\right],
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $H$ is modeled as a random oracle.
\end{theorem}
The proof combines details from the proofs of count min-sketch bounds and the
proofs of Bloom filter bounds. In particular, we begin by following an argument
as in the count min-sketch case to limit the advantage the adversary can get
from deleting elements and from re-inserting elements of the original set. There
is a difference in the counting filter case in that \emph{inserting} a known
false positive cannot benefit the adversary, while \emph{deleting} it can. This
is the opposite of the count min-sketch case, but the effect on the bound is
quite similar. In each case we give the adversary additional credit for finding
these false positives while constraining them to not modify false positives they
find. This causes $r'$ to appear in the proof bound rather than $r$ in each
case, but because of the different error functions the definitions of $r'$ are
slightly different.
%
After this step, we observe that a counting filter without
deletion behaves the same as an ordinary Bloom filter in terms of how it
responds to queries. We can therefore borrow the arguments used to establish the
bounds in Theorem~\ref{thm:sbf-erreps-th} to finish the proof.

We defer the details of the proof to Appendix~\ref{sec:proof/counting-erreps}.

\subsection{Discussion}
The results for counting filters are similar to the results for count-min
sketch, as might be expected given the similarities in terms of both the
supported updates and the structure of the representations themselves (any
count-min sketch can be transformed into a counting filter by adding all the
rows together element-wise.) In particular, we again see that counting filters
which are publicly visible cannot provide good security guarantees. This means
that counting filters intended for a security-sensitive setting should be kept
hidden from potential adversaries. Furthermore, our bound relies on
per-representation random salts and $\ell$-thresholding, so these changes should
also be taken into account when constructing secure counting filters. The size
increase of the filters is comparable to the size increase of count
min-sketches, but is distinct in that it depends on the relative weight of false
positives as opposed to false negatives. False negatives impact the bound more
than false positives due to the scaling factor of $k$ that appears in $r'$,
which indicates that applications seeking to minimize false negatives will
require larger filters than those seeking to minimize false positives. This is
distinctly different than in the non-adaptive setting, where false positives are
much more common in counting filters than false negatives, and therefore much
more relevant in determining the minimum size of the filter.
