\caption{Games 0, 1, and 2 for proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:sbf-erreps}.}

\end{figure*}

As in previous proofs, we assume without loss of generality that there are no
insertions of or queries for elements of $\col$, and we start with a
game~$\game_0$ that is identical to the \erreps\ game for $\KBF_\mathrm{ft}$.
\cpnote{Where is~$\game_0$? Refer to the figure.}

To avoid the unfortunate $q_R$ factor in the bound, we do not make use of
Lemma~\ref{thm:lemma1} in this proof. Because of that, we must find some other
way to ensure that $\REVO$ is not useful to the adversary. In particular, if
there are unique salts across representations, the $\REPO$, $\QRYO$, and $\UPO$
calls for one representation will be independent of those for other
representations, since the unique salt is passed as part of the input. Therefore
in~$\game_1$ we specify that all salts created will be unique, but deny access
to $\REVO$. By the birthday bound, the probability of salts repeating
in~$\game_0$ is no more than $q_R^2/2^\lambda$. If the representations are
independent, calling $\REVO$ would provide no information about other
representations, and would in fact only weaken the adversary by causing some
possible outputs $i \in [q_R]$ to be automatic losses. So we have
$\Prob{\game_0(\advA) = 1} \le q_R^2/2^\lambda + \Prob{\game_1(\advB) = 1}$,
where $\advB$ is an adversary that performs identically to $\advA$ but is
syntactically distinct because it lacks a $\REVO$ oracle.

Next, we want to ensure that the adversary's $\HASHO_1$ queries are independent
of the $\HASHO_2$ and $\HASHO_3$ queries used for $\REPO$, $\QRYO$, and $\UPO$.
Since the $\HASHO_c$ oracles use random sampling to fill a shared table, this
occurs if and only if the adversary calls
$\HASHO_1(\langle\salt_i,x\rangle)$\todo{DC}{Fix syntax}
for some salt $\salt_i$ used by one of the representations created by $\REPO$.
By an argument very similar to that in the previous proofs, the adversary has at
most $q_H/2^\lambda$ probability of calling $\HASHO_1$ with the salt used by
some specific representation. However, since there are now $q_R$
representations, each with a distinct salt, there is at most a
$q_Rq_H/2^\lambda$ probability of the adversary correctly guessing a salt.
In~$\game_1(\advB)$, we set the $\bad_1$ flag if the adversary succeeds in
guessing the salt in this manner, but the flag does not affect the game. The
case of~$\game_2(\advB)$ is identical until the $\bad_1$ flag is set, which
occurs only when a salt is guessed, so we have $\Prob{\game_1(\advB) = 1} \le
q_Rq_H/2^\lambda + \Prob{\game_2(\advB) = 1}$.

We may now assume~\cpnote{Actually, this is by \textbf{construction}! In the
revised game, the adversary is never handed the correct salt, and it's never
handed any RO output whose input is preprended by the salt. it's not the
aadversary never ``guesses'' it, it's that it doesn't matter if it does! This
the real power game-based proofs. Please revise this, here and elsehwere.} that
the adversary never guesses the salt of any of the
representations, and so the outputs of $\HASHO_1$ are independent of the results
of all calls to $\REPO$, $\QRYO$, and $\UPO$. The next oracle we want to target
is $\UPO$. Now that we have a filter threshold, we want to argue that the
adversary cannot use $\UPO$ to mount an effective pollution attack.
%
\cpnote{You're implicitly assuming that pollution attacks are the best we can
do. Why is this true? It doesn't seem to me like it's true. Maybe it is at this
point in the proof, because we've already dealt with the salt guessing? If
that's the case, we can't call it a ``pollution attack'', since this the
experiment has changed.}
%
In~$\game_3(C)$, the $\REPO$ oracle creates the filter as normal and then
randomly sets bits until filter is full (i.e., its Hamming weight is at least
$\ell$), which is $\ell+k$ (since
updates are not allowed when more than $\ell$ bits are set, and a single update
may set at most $k$ bits to 1). For any $\advB$ in~$\game_2$, we can construct
$C$ for~$\game_3$ that obtains at least as large an advantage by having $C$
simulate $\advB$, forwarding all oracle queries in the natural way except that
$\UPO$ queries are ignored, with $C$ simply returning $\top$ to $\advB$ without
performing any additional computations or oracle calls. (Recall that, in the
\erreps setting, the adversry expects $\top$ to be the output of~$\UPO$.) Since $\advB$ does not
query elements which are already in $\col$, the outputs of $\HASHO_3$ calls are
independent of any prior $\HASHO_2$ calls.
%
The probability of such an output producing a false positive is strictly a
function of the number of bits in the filter which have been set to 1.
%
Since at least as many bits have been set to 1 in~$\game_3$ as in~$\game_2$,
every $\QRYO$ call is at least as likely to produce a false positive. Therefore
$\Prob{\game_2(\advB) = 1} \le \Prob{\game_3(C) = 1}$.

In~$\game_3$ we can assume without loss of generality that the adversary makes
no $\UPO$ calls, since the filter is already full and no additional updates will
be accepted. \cpnote{Why assume this? The adversary can make as many $\UPO$
queries it wants and it won't make a difference. So why stop it? The reason not
to is that, as a general good, it's good to keep your assumptions minimal.} Since each
representation is created using independent $\HASHO_2$ outputs and then filled
in a uniform random manner until $\ell+k$ bits are set to 1, and is never
modified afterwards, the representations
themselves are random bitmaps which are uniformly distributed over the set of
$m$-length bitmaps with $\ell+k$ bits set to 1. This allows us to move
to~$\game_4(D)$, where the adversary is given a single arbitrary bitmap $\pub$
of length $m$ with $\ell+k$ bits set to 1 and makes $\QRYO$ calls exclusively
for $\pub$, winning if it produces $r$ errors for that `representation'. Given
an adversary $C$ for~$\game_3$, we construct a $D$ for~$\game_4$ that simulates
$C$. When $C$ makes a $\REPO$ call, $D$ immediately returns $\top$ to $C$, and
when $C$ makes a $\QRYO(i,\qry_x)$ call, $D$ selects a random
previously-unqueried element $y$ and calls $\QRYO(y)$, returning the result to
$C$. \cpnote{What about~$C$'s $\HASHO_1$ queries?} Since representations are uniformly distributed and $\HASHO_3$ calls are
independent of the $\HASHO_2$ calls used to construct the representation, each
$\QRYO$ call made by $D$ has the same chance of producing a hit as the $\QRYO$
call made by $C$ has of producing a false positive.
%
\cpnote{What about queries $(i,\qry_x)$ and $(j,\qry_x)$? $D$'s response will be
the same for both, but $C$ is expecting independent outputs.}
%
The win conditions differ
only in that $D$ wins by accumulating $r$ positive results, whereas $C$ must
accumulate $r$ false positives within a single representation, and so $D$ wins
if $\advB$\todo{DC}{You mean $C$?} does. Therefore $\Prob{\game_3(C) = 1} \le \Prob{\game_4(D) = 1}$.

However, since $\QRYO$ calls with distinct inputs have independent outputs, each $\QRYO$ call made by $D$ has the same probability of producing a false positive. In particular, the probability of any one of the $k$ outputs of $\HASHO_3$ colliding with a 1 bit is $(\ell+k)/m$, and the probability of all $k$ outputs doing so is then $((\ell+k)/m)^k$. If we let $\setX$ be the set of all inputs made to $\QRYO$, we again have a binomial distribution where $q_T$ queries are made. Letting $p_\ell = ((\ell+k)/m)^k$, we have
\begin{equation}
   \Prob{\game_4(D)=1} \le
     \sum_{i=r}^{q_T} \binom{q_T}{i}p_\ell^i(1-p_\ell)^{q_T-i} \,,
\end{equation}
and we can once more apply a Chernoff bound, as long as $p_\ell q_T < r$, to simplify this to
\begin{equation}
   \Prob{\game_4(D)=1} \le
     e^{r-p_\ell q_T}\left(\frac{p_\ell q_T}{r}\right)^r.
\end{equation}

Substituting this into our earlier inequalities yields the final bound of
\begin{equation}
   \Adv{\erreps}_{\Pi,\delta,r}(\advA) \leq
     \frac{q_R(q_H+q_R)}{2^\lambda} + e^{r-p_\ell q_T}\left(\frac{p_\ell q_T}{r}\right)^r.
\end{equation}
