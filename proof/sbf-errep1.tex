We will use the following lemma for keyless structures.
%
\todo{DC (lead)}{Prove this in the appendix.}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:lemma1}
  For every $q_R, q_T, q_U, q_H, r, t \geq 0$ and keyless structure~$\Gamma$ it
  holds that
  \begin{equation*}
    \Adv{\errep}_{\Gamma,\delta,r}(t, q_R, q_T, q_U, q_H) \leq
    q_R\Adv{\errep1}_{\Gamma,\delta,r}(O(f(t)), q_T, q_U, q_H) \,,
  \end{equation*}
  where $f(t) = t + (q_R-1)\ticks(\Rep,t) + q_T\ticks(\Qry,t) + q_U\ticks(\Up,t)$.
  \todo{Any}{Define $\Adv{\errep1}_{\cdot,\cdot,\cdot}(\cdots)$.}
\end{lemma}
%
%
\noindent
The proof is by a fairly straight-forward hybrid argument. Because~$\Gamma$ is
keyless, in the reduction we simulate $q_R-1$ $\REPO$-queries experiment and use
our own oracles for the remaining query. The best we can do with this strategy
is to ``guess'' which representation the \errep\ adversary willl use in its
attack, which results in the~$q_R$ factor in the bound.
%
We defer the full details to Appendix~\ref{app:iproof/lemma1}.

Let $\advA$ be an \errep\ adversary making~$1$ query to~$\REPO$, $q_T$ queries
to $\QRYO$, $0$ queries to $\UPO$, and $q_H$ queries to the random
oracle~$\HASHO$.
%
We make the following assumptions, all of which are without loss of generality.
%
First, all of~$\advA$'s $\QRYO$ queries proceed its $\REPO$ query.
%
Second, we assume that $x\not\in\setS$ for all queries $\qry_x$ to $\QRYO$,
where~$\setS$ was the input to~$\advA$'s $\REPO$ query. This is without loss
because Bloom filtersadmit false positives, but not false negatives
%
Third, we we assume that $|\setS| \leq n$; this is without loss because
otherwise~$\REPO$ outputs~$\bot$ and~$\advA$ gets no advantage.

Fourth, we assume that all of~$\advA$'s $\HASHO$ queries are of the form $Z\cat
x$, where $|Z| = \lambda$.

We begin with a game-playing argument~\cite{bellare2006triple}, then obtain the
final bound via applicaition of Lemma~\ref{thm:lemma1}.
%
\cpnote{Here's the proof sketch.}
%
The high-level goal is to rewrite the game so that the probability that one
of~$\advA$'s queries runs up the score is is precisely the false positive
probability for Bloom filters in the usual analytical
setting~\cite{kirsch2006less}. In other words, our goal is transistion into a
setting in which the Bloom filter output by~$\REPO$ is independent of the
outcome of~$\advA$'s other queries.

We begin with the game~$\game_0(\advB)$ defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:sbf-errep1/games}. It is similar to the \errep\ experiment when
executed with~$\advA$, $\Pi$, $\delta$, and~$r$. Indeed, it is not difficult to
see that for every~$\advA$ there exists an adversary~$\advB$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \Adv{\errep}_{\Pi,\delta,r}(\advA) \leq \Prob{\game_0(\advB) = 1}
\end{equation}
and~$\advB$ has the same query resources as~$\advA$.
%
Adversary~$\advB$ executes~$\advA$, forwarding~$\advA$'s oracle queries
to its own oracles in the natural way.

Observe that in game~$\game_0$ the salt used for the representation of~$\setS^*$
is generated prior to executing~$\advB$. Game~$\game_1$ is identical
to~$\game_0$ until the flag~$\bad_1$ gets set by oracle~$\HASHO$. This occurs
if~$\advB$ asks $\HASHO_1(\salt^* \cat x)$, where~$\salt^*$ is the salt generated
at the beginning of the game, and it has not yet called $\QRYO$ (i.e.,
$M^*=\bot$).
%
By the Fundamental Lemma of Geame Playing~\cite{bellare2006triple} it follows
that
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Prob{\game_0(\advB)=1} &\leq&
    \Prob{\game_1(\advB)=1} + \Prob{\game_1(\advB) \sets \bad_1}\\
  &\leq&
    \Prob{\game_1(\advB)=1} + q_H/2^\lambda \,.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Note that in $\game_1$, the value of~$M^*$ is independent of~$\advB$'s
$\HASHO_1$ queries. In particular, the probability that some bit of~$M^*$ is set
is independent of the choices of~$\advB$.

In game $\game_2$ the $\HASHO$ and $\QRYO$ oracles have been rewritten so that
the winning-condition is computed by $\HASHO$ instead of $\QRYO$. The former
oracle maintains a set~$\Ans$ such that $\Ans[x] = \Qry^{\HASHO_3}(M^*, x)$ for
each query $\salt^* \cat x$; on input of $\qry_x$, oracle~$\QRYO$ simply runs
$\HASHO_3(\salt^* \cat x$ and returns $\Ans[x]$.
%
We are effectively giving the adverseary credit for RO queries that result in
false positives for the representation of~$\setS^*$, but which it does not
explicitly ask of the~$\QRYO$. Clearly, for every~$\advB$ it holds that
%
\begin{equation}
  \Prob{\game_1(\advB)=1} \leq \Prob{\game_2(\advB)=1} \,.
\end{equation}

We now consider $\Prob{\game_2(\advB)=1}$.
%
Let $\setX$ be the set $\{ x \in \bits^* : \Ans[x] \ne \bot \}$ and $\setT = \{x
\in\setX: \Ans[x] = 1\}$, where $\Ans$ is at is defined when~$\advB$ halts. We
will call~$\setX$ the set of attempts and~$\setT$ the set of false positives.
%
Note that $\setX\intersection\setS^*=\emptyset$ by construction, and that
$|\setX| \leq q_H + q_T$.
%
Hence, the probability that~$\game_2(\advB)=1$ is equal to the probability
that~$|\setT| \geq r$.
