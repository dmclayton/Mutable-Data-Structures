The count min-sketch (CMS) data structure is designed to concisely estimate the
number of times a datum has occurred in a data stream. In other words, it is
designed to estimate the frequency of each element of a multiset. The data
structure is similar to a Bloom filter, but instead of a length-$m$ array of
bits it uses a $k$-by-$m$ array of counters. It is designed to deal with streams
of data in the non-negative turnstile model~\cite{cormode2005improved}, which
means the sketch accommodates both insertions and deletions but does not allow
any entries to have a negative frequency.
Despite this, we will see that the two structures are closely related in
terms of security properties. We show that \errep\ security is similarly
impossible, but employing $\ell$-thresholding allows for \erreps\ security with a
bound that is close to count min-sketch.

\heading{Non-adaptive error bound}
%
The CMS is designed to minimize the number of elements whose
frequencies are overestimated, while still allowing for reasonably low memory
usage. For a function $\rho$ and integer $\lambda\ge0$, let
$\sketch[\id^\rho,n,\lambda] = (\Rep^\rho,\Qry^\rho,\Up^\rho)$ as defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:cms-def}. If $\col$ is a multiset containing a total of $n$ elements
(counting duplicates as separate elements), i.e. $\col \in \Func(\bits^*,\N)$ in
our syntax, and $x \in \bits^*$ is any string, possibly but not necessarily a
member of $\col$, we define the error probability as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bf-fp}
  \begin{aligned}
    P'_{k,m}(n) =
      \Pr\big[&\rho \getsr \Func(\bits^*,[m]^k);
              \pub \getsr \Rep^\rho(\setS): \\
              &\Qry^\rho(\pub, \qry_x) > \qry_x(\setS)+\frac{en}{m} \given \pub \ne \bot
      \big] \,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
(Here as above, $e$ denotes the base of the natural logarithm.)
%
Informally, $P'_{k,m}(n)$ is the probability that some~$x$ is overestimated by a
non-negligible amount in the representation of some $\setS$ containing a total
of $n$ elements, when a random function is used for hashing. Cormode and
Muthukrishnan~\cite{cormode2005improved} show that this probability is bounded
above by $e^{-k}$. This structure does not provide a bound for underestimation
of frequencies, since it is designed for use cases where overestimates are
considered harmful but underestimates are not.

\heading{Error function for frequency queries}
%
The count min-sketch is designed for settings where overestimation in particular
is undesirable, and so we aim to provide tight bounds on the size of
overestimates but makes no guarantees about underestimates. To make the bounds
simpler while staying conservative in our assumptions, we will use an error
function that counts \emph{any} overestimate as an error, not just overestimates
larger than some lower bound of significance. In particular, we define~$\delta$
as
%
\begin{equation}
  \delta(x, y) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if}\ x > y \\
    0 & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Note that other $\delta(x,y)$ may be preferable in some applications. For
example, if the degree of error is significant, it may be desirable to use a $\delta$
which only counts as an error if $x$ and $y$ differ by more than some threshold value,
or to use a function such as $\delta(x,y) = |x-y|$. In this paper we use this
error bound because it is in some sense the most conservative, counting any
overestimate as an error.

\subsection{Insecurity of public sketches}

The count min-sketch structure necessarily fails to satisfy \errep\
correctness for the same reasons as in the case of a counting filter. In
particular, the adversary can call $\REPO(\emptyset)$ to receive an empty
representation, insert an element $x$, observe which counters are incremented by
this insertion, and then delete $x$. (Again, this is possible only because the
sketch is public). By doing this repeatedly, the adversary can
gain information about which elements overlap with which combinations of other
elements, and can therefore mount the same attack described in
Section~\ref{sec:pub-count-bad}.

\subsection{Private, $\ell$-thresholded sketches}
\label{sec:sketch-proof}

Given the success of $\ell$-thresholding in the case of Bloom filters, we
continue using this tweak in the case of count min-sketches. Between
thresholding and the use of a per-representation random salt, we are able to
establish an upper bound on the number of overestimates in a count min-sketch.
However, the bound is not quite as good as in the case of a salted and
thresholded Bloom filter, which is unsurprising given the increased flexibility
provided by the update algorithm coupled with the additional
information returned by the query evaluation algorithm.
%
Formally, we consider the structure given by $\Pi = \sketch[H,\ell,\lambda]$ for
a hash function $H: \bits^* \to [m]^k$, which we will model as a random oracle.

\begin{theorem}[\erreps\ security of thresholded CMS]\label{thm:scms-erreps-th}
Let $p_\ell = ((\ell+1)/m)^k$. For all $q_R, q_T, q_U, q_H, q_V, r, t \geq 0$
it holds that
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \Adv{\erreps}_{\Pi,\delta,r}(O(t),\,&q_R,q_T,q_U,q_H,q_V) \leq q_R \cdot \left[\frac{q_H}{2^\lambda} + e^{r'-p_\ell q_T}\left(\frac{p_\ell q_T}{r'}\right)^r\right],
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $H$ is modeled as a random oracle, $r' = \lfloor r/(k+1) \rfloor$, and $r'
> p_\ell q_T$.
\end{theorem}

The proof uses a game-playing argument in which we gradually whittle away at the flexibility
the adversary has in performing repeated insertions, deletions, and queries to
the same elements. The $r'$ in place of $r$ in the bound comes from the fact
that, if the adversary finds that some $x$ is overestimated, it may be able to
produce as many as $k$ additional overestimates by inserting $x$. We take this
into account by automatically giving the adversary credit for all $k$ additional
overestimates as soon as it discovers the false positive. After taking this into
account, we can reduce to the standard binomial argument in which the adversary
seeks to find $r'$ overestimates by making arbitrary queries.

\ignore{Now that we have proven Theorem~\ref{thm:scms-erreps-th}, we now return to the case
of the counting filter for the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:counting-erreps}. While the two structures
appear rather different due to the two-dimensional nature of sketches and their
support for frequency queries rather than simple membership queries, the security
proofs turn out to be quite similar. In particular, due to our choice of error
function, the proofs coincide as soon as we have managed to reduce to the case
where the adversary makes no deletions. In this scenario, false positives arise
in a counting filter in precisely the same way that overestimates arise in a count
min-sketch. Once we have reduced to the no-deletion scenario, the proofs become
almost identical, an interesting result which might extend to other data structures
as well.

\subsection{Discussion}
The results for count min-sketches are similar to the results for counting
filters, as might be expected given the similarities in terms of both the
supported updates and the structure of the representations themselves (any
count min-sketch can be transformed into a counting filter by adding all the
rows together element-wise.) In particular, we see that count min-sketches
which are publicly visible cannot provide good security guarantees. This means
that sketches intended for a security-sensitive setting should be kept
hidden from potential adversaries. Furthermore, our bound relies on
per-representation random salts and $\ell$-thresholding, so these changes should
also be taken into account when constructing secure count min-sketches. The size
increase of the sketches is comparable to the size increase of counting filters,
but does not need to take into account multiple types of errors

The bound we achieve is based on the same binomial bound as in the case of Bloom
filters, but has a notable difference in the form of $r'$ replacing $r$. This
negatively impacts the amount of space the filter must take up in order to
provide low error bounds, but because the scaling factor between $r$ and $r'$ is
only $k+1$, the difference should not be unacceptably extreme given reasonable
parameter choices. We also note that it is possible this bound can be improved
to reduce the impact on sketch size, since the initial factor of $q_R$ does not
have an obvious attack associated with it which would make this bound tight.

(The same is true, of course, of Bloom and counting filters.)
