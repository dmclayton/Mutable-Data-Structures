We start with a universe $\mathcal{D}$ of data objects, a key space $\keys$, a set $\mathcal{R}$ of responses equipped with a metric $d: \mathcal{R}^2 \to [0,\infty)$, a set $\mathcal{Q} = \{\qry: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{R}\}$ of queries, and a set $\mathcal{U} = \{\up: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}\}$ of possible updates. A {\em mutable data structure} is a tuple $\Pi = (\Rep,\Qry,\Up)$, where: \tsnote{Should the error metric be part of the syntax?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Rep: \keys \times \mathcal{D} \to \{0,1\}^*$ is a randomized {\em representation algorithm}, taking as input a key $\key \in \keys$ and data object $\col \in \mathcal{D}$, and outputting the public representation $\pub \in \{0,1\}^*$ of $D$. We write this as $\pub \getsr \Rep_\key(\col)$.
  \item $\Qry: \keys \times \{0,1\}^* \times \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{R}$ is a deterministic {\em query-evaluation algorithm}, taking as input $\key \in \keys$, $\pub \in \{0,1\}^*$, and $\qry \in \mathcal{Q}$, and outputting an answer $a \in \mathcal{R}$. We write this as $a \gets \Qry_\key(\pub,\qry)$.
  \item $\Up: \keys \times \{0,1\}^* \times \mathcal{U} \to \{0,1\}^*$ is a randomized {\em update algorithm}, taking as input $\key \in \keys$, $\pub \in \{0,1\}^*$, and $\up \in \mathcal{U}$, and outputting an updated representation $\pub'$. We write this as $\pub' \getsr \Up_\key(\pub,\up)$.
\end{itemize}

Unkeyed data structures are a special case where $\keys = \{\epsilon\}$, and immutable data structures are a special case where the update algorithm returns $\textsc{Up}(\key,\pub,\up)=\pub$ for all inputs.  In the latter case, we will often drop mention of the update algorithm.


Say that a structure is {\em invertible} if for every representation $\mathsf{pub}$ and update $\mathsf{up} \in \mathcal{U}$ there is $\mathsf{up}' \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $\Prob{\textsc{Up}(\textsc{Up}(\mathsf{pub},\mathsf{up}),\mathsf{up}' = \mathsf{pub})} = 1$.  For example, the updates for both counting Bloom filters and count-min sketches are invertible, by consequence of being deterministic and having both insertion and deletion operations. Each also has the additional feature of having a natural choice of {\em empty} structure such that every other structure can be constructed by starting with the empty structure and performing a corresponding sequence of update operations.
